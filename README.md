# Guess-my-number-game

Making a small game work (Guess my number) by applying Js knowledge

In this game a random number between 1 and 30 is generated and you have to guess that number based on the hints.

How it Works:

-You will have to type a number between 1 and 30, trying to guess the random number.

-If you guess it right, you will have a score (Max: 20) based on how much times you tried

-If you guess it wrong, you will lose 1 score point and the game will show you a hint if your guess was too low or too high.

-If your Score gets to 0, you lose the game.
